1. The Vision: Our Guiding Star

We are not building a notes app. We are building a Digital Sanctuary.

Kensho Journal is an intelligent, private space designed for self-reflection. Its mission is to help users understand their own thoughts and feelings, turning their daily journal into an insightful, interactive partner.

2. The Core Product Strategy

Our strategy is to win the market by being more insightful than the free options and more intelligent than the paid ones.

The Free Tier: "Master of Insight"

Goal: To be the best free journaling tool on the market.

Unique Selling Proposition (USP): We are better than default notes apps because we provide instant AI analysis after every entry. A user's thoughts are not just stored; they are reflected back with clarity.

Core Free Features:

A flawless, minimalist writing environment.

Instant AI Analysis Card (Mood, Themes, Summary) after every entry.

A 7-Day Mood Dashboard to visualize recent trends.

The "On This Day" feature for daily nostalgia.

The Premium Tier: "Master of Conversation"

Goal: To offer a genuine "superpower" for self-reflection that is worth paying for.

Unique Selling Proposition (USP): We are better than other premium journals because we offer a conversational AI. Users can have an intelligent dialogue with their entire life's journal.

Core Premium Features:

The Killer Feature: "Ask Your Journal." The ability to ask questions in natural language and get summarized answers based on past entries.

Unlimited Dashboard & Analytics: The 7-day limit is removed, revealing long-term patterns.

Automated Weekly/Monthly Reports.

Full Data Export.

3. The User Journey: The First Week is Everything

Our user retention strategy is built on a powerful, guided first-week experience.

The First Session ("Welcome Reflection"): We deliver an "Aha!" moment in the first 60 seconds with an interactive "Mood Intake" that demonstrates the app's intelligence before the user even writes a full entry.

The First Week ("Mindful Momentum" Program): We guide the user through a 7-day journey of cascading rewards. We use daily emails and in-app unlocks to help them build the journaling habit and populate their dashboard, turning an empty app into a valuable, personal space.

4. The Technology Stack

This is the modern, efficient toolkit we will use to build the product.

Framework: Next.js (using the App Router for both frontend and backend API routes).

Database & Auth: Supabase (providing our PostgreSQL database, user authentication, and pgvector for AI).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (for rapid, professional UI development).

Deployment: Vercel (for seamless, one-click deployments from GitHub).

AI Engine: OpenAI API (for both analysis and conversational features).

5. The Development Plan

We have a focused, 12-week sprint plan designed for a solo developer dedicating 7-10 hours per week.

Phase 1 (Weeks 0-2): Foundation. Project setup, static layouts, and UI for authentication.

Phase 2 (Weeks 3-8): MVP Core. Implementing user accounts, the journaling engine, AI insights, and the onboarding experience.

Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Premium & Polish. Building the "Ask Your Journal" feature, integrating payments, and preparing for launch.

6. The Business Goal: Sustainability

Our primary goal is to create a self-sustaining product.

Price: â‚¹99 per month.

Target Conversion Rate: 1-2% of monthly active users.

The Milestone: Reaching ~25 paying subscribers to cover the monthly operational costs.
