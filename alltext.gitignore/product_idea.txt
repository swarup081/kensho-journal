1. The Name & Brand

Name: Kensho Journal

Tagline: The Journal That Talks Back.

Domain: kenshojournal.app

Logo: The minimalist, elegant archway with a single dot in the center, representing a sanctuary of insight.

2. The Product Philosophy: "A Living Sanctuary"

We are not building a sterile notes app. We are building a Digital Sanctuary that is alive with personality and color. It is a calm, intelligent, and private space designed for deep self-reflection. It should feel like a handcrafted, personal object that helps users understand their own minds.

3. The UI/UX Philosophy: "Light for Welcome, Dark for Focus"

Our app uses a strategic dual-theme approach to guide the user's experience.

Light Theme (Public Pages): The Landing Page and Sign Up/In pages will use a light, airy, and inviting theme. This builds trust and feels welcoming to new users. The design is based on your mockup: a soft off-white background (#F9F9F7), abstract colorful shapes, and a vibrant gradient button.

Dark Theme (The Private App): Once a user logs in, the interface shifts to a focused, immersive dark theme. This is the user's private sanctuary. It reduces eye strain and makes the colorful, data-driven visualizations the hero of the experience, inspired by your "Insights" and "Dashboard" mockups.

5. The User Journey: The First Week is Everything
