1. The Brand & Philosophy

Name: Kensho Journal

Tagline: The Journal That Talks Back.

Domain: kenshojournal.app

Logo: The minimalist, elegant archway with a single dot in the center, representing a sanctuary of insight.

Product Philosophy: "A Living Sanctuary"
We are not building a sterile notes app. We are building a Digital Sanctuary that is alive with personality and color. It is a calm, intelligent, and private space designed for deep self-reflection. It should feel like a handcrafted, personal object that helps users understand their own minds.

UI/UX Philosophy: "Light for Welcome, Dark for Focus"
Our app uses a strategic dual-theme approach. The public-facing pages (Landing, Sign Up) use a light, airy, and inviting theme to build trust. The private, logged-in application (Dashboard, Editor) uses a focused, immersive dark theme to reduce eye strain and make the user's personal data and insights the vibrant hero of the experience.

3. The Product Strategy

The Free Tier: "Master of Insight"

A 7-Day Mood Dashboard to visualize recent trends.

The "On This Day" feature for daily nostalgia.

The Premium Tier: "Master of Conversation"

Goal: To offer a genuine "superpower" for self-reflection that is worth paying for.

4. The User Experience Strategy

Our user retention strategy is built on a powerful, guided first-week experience.

The First Session ("Welcome Reflection"): We deliver an "Aha!" moment in the first 60 seconds with an interactive "Mood Intake" that demonstrates the app's intelligence before the user even writes a full entry.

The First Week ("Mindful Momentum" Program): We guide the user through a 7-day journey of cascading rewards. We use daily emails and in-app unlocks to help them build the journaling habit and populate their dashboard, turning an empty app into a valuable, personal space.

5. The Execution Plan

Tech Stack: Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Database & Auth), Tailwind CSS, Vercel (Deployment), OpenAI API.

Project Structure: A clean, organized structure with separate folders for app (routes), components (UI), and lib (helpers).


Development Plan: A focused, 12-week sprint plan designed for a solo developer dedicating 7-10 hours per week.
